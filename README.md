## Description
This is where I will have my WIP self developed personal portfolio/website when I have some time to commit to learning HTML/CSS/Javascript.  
I will probably start this after I secure a full time position, as I am currently learning firmware skills to get a job that interests me. 

### Progression of learning
As I will be trying to develop this from scratch I will probably follow the standard process of learning the steps, listed in the headings below. 
Maybe eventually I will try to convert this to python, maybe for fun and not for actual usage, but that'll be much later.

#### HTML

#### CSS

#### Javascript
